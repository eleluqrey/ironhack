# Ironhack Data Analytics Labs

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account and clone the forked repository into your `ironhack` folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/<lab-repo>.git
```
Git will create a new folder named as the repository you're cloning and will convert it automatically into a git repository.



2. Once you're into your newly created folder (repository) you can create a new branch for start an assignment:

```
$ git checkout -b <lab-name>
```

Each project/lab has its own directory in which you'll find a `README.md` file with instructions and requirements and, in most of them, sub-directories named `your-code` and `data` containing code and data respectively. When you work on the assignment, create your code files in the `your-code` directory and save regularly while you work using:

```
$ git add <files-to-add>
$ git commit -m "lab-started"
$ git push origin <branch-name>
```

After you finish, perform a last commit as follow:

```
$ git add <files-to-add>
$ git commit -m "lab-finished"
$ git push origin <branch-name>
```

The instructional team will review your branch and provide feedback.

**To work on the subsequent assignments**, create a new branch for every new assignment.

:exclamation: You may be asked in the future to update your forked repo because the curriculum development team is developing new assignments for you as the course proceeds. 

### Happy coding!
